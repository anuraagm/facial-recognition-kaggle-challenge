# facial-recognition-kaggle-challenge

In order to run this code it is recommended to simply follow the link to the [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aY6nBSSqxnK8zgI1rF0xxoK1NjD_mo0Z?usp=share_link) and run the cells. Please note that before you run the colab notebook, you must download the dataset files images.zip from this kaggle [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samaneheslamifar/facial-emotion-expressions). Place it in the '/content/' folder in Colab. If you do not do this then the data will be absent and the code cannot run.

But in the event that you wish to run it on your local system, please follow the following steps.

* Clone this repository onto your system
* Open a terminal in the project folder and run the command "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
* Download the images.zip file with all the train and validation data from kaggle at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samaneheslamifar/facial-emotion-expressions).
* Unzip the contents into the same location as the python notebook.
* Start jupyter in the terminal by running 'jupyter notebook'.
* Visit http://localhost:8888 and select the 'ipynb' file.
* Click 'Kernel' in the menu bar and select 'Restart and Run All Cells'
